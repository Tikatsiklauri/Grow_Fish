# Grow Fish
## Background and Overview
Help the little fish grow by catching smaller fish while avoiding big ones
## Functionality and MVPs
* Landing page, modal with instructions
* Player is a small fish that earns (grows in) centimeters as it eats (collides with) smaller fish than itself.
* Player fish has to navigate away from randomly generated bigger fish swimming towards it
* Game is over when collision with bigger fish occurs
* Bigger fish that need to be avoided get speedier as player fish starts growing bigger and gets closer to the set centimeters
* When player fish reaches set centimeter the game automatically goes into the next level, slowing down fish flow, decreasing the player fish size again, and increasing desired centimeters to be reached
